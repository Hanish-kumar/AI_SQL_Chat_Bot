# AI_SQL_Chat_Bot
Hello,
this project involves the creation of a web-based chat application that enables users to query a SQL database using natural language. The core functionality lies in its ability to translate user input into executable SQL queries, retrieve the relevant data, and present the findings in an understandable natural language format. The application also incorporates conversational memory, allowing for context-aware follow-up questions.
Web application has been launched!
